# Introduction
BBOA are important for the radiative effective 
but the magnitude and even direction are unclear
see Haywood et al (2000).
Our measurments set out to add to this body of knowledge using 
Mass Spectrometer data.

# Simulations
John's box model is consistent with congraduation as the dominant growth
mechanism
